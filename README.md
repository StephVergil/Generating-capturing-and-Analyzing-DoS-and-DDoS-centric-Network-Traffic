# Generating, Capturing, and Analyzing DoS and DDoS-centric Network Traffic

## Overview

This project explores the behaviors, impacts, and mitigation strategies for Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. Through hands-on simulations, network traffic analysis, and testing mitigation techniques, this project aims to provide an in-depth understanding of these network-based threats and how to counter them effectively.

---

## Objectives

1. **Simulate DoS and DDoS Attacks**: Leverage tools to generate realistic attack traffic.
2. **Capture and Analyze Network Traffic**: Use advanced monitoring tools to identify attack characteristics.
3. **Understand Attack Signatures**: Study packet-level details of SYN floods, UDP floods, and HTTP GET floods.
4. **Evaluate Mitigation Strategies**: Test various defensive measures, such as rate limiting, IP filtering, and intrusion detection systems.

---

## Tools and Technologies

1. **Wireshark**: For capturing and analyzing network packets in detail.
2. **Nmap**: To scan and map networks, identifying vulnerabilities and targets.
3. **Hping3**: A packet-crafting tool used to simulate network-layer attacks.
4. **LOIC/HOIC**: Open-source tools to simulate DoS and DDoS attacks in a safe environment.
5. **Snort**: A powerful intrusion detection and prevention system (IDS/IPS) for alert generation.

## Key Steps

### 1. **Environment Setup**
- **Controlled Lab Environment**: Ensure simulations occur in a secure, isolated environment to avoid unintended consequences.
- **Tool Installation**: Install and verify the functionality of all required tools (Wireshark, Snort, Hping3, etc.).

### 2. **Simulating DoS and DDoS Attacks**
- **Attack Types**:
  - **SYN Flood**: Overwhelm servers with incomplete TCP handshake requests.
  - **UDP Flood**: Saturate the target with UDP packets.
  - **HTTP GET Flood**: Overload web servers with excessive HTTP requests.
- **Execution**:
  - Use `Hping3` to send crafted packets:
    ```bash
    hping3 -S -p <port> <target_IP> --flood
    ```
  - Simulate DDoS traffic using **LOIC** or **HOIC** by configuring distributed sources.

### 3. **Capturing Network Traffic**
- Monitor live traffic with Wireshark and save `.pcap` files for later analysis.
- Apply display filters in Wireshark to identify attack patterns:
  - SYN Flood:
    ```
    tcp.flags.syn==1 and tcp.flags.ack==0
    ```
  - UDP Flood:
    ```
    udp
    ```

### 4. **Traffic Analysis**
- **Identify Patterns**:
  - High packet rates in a short duration.
  - Repeated TCP SYN packets without corresponding ACKs.
  - Spoofed IP addresses indicating DDoS.
- **Use Snort for Alerting**:
  - Enable Snort rules to detect DoS traffic:
    ```bash
    alert tcp any any -> any any (flags:S; msg:"SYN Flood Detected"; threshold:type threshold, track by_src, count 20, seconds 5;)
    ```

### 5. **Mitigation Testing**
- **Rate Limiting**: Restrict the rate of incoming traffic to prevent resource exhaustion.
- **IP Filtering**: Block malicious IPs using access control lists (ACLs) or firewalls.
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Protect web servers against HTTP floods.
- **Network-Level Defense**: Implement anti-DDoS solutions such as traffic scrubbing or blackholing.

## Key Findings

- **DoS Traffic Characteristics**:
  - High volume of packets from a single source.
  - Frequent incomplete TCP handshakes (SYN floods).
- **DDoS Traffic Characteristics**:
  - Multiple distributed sources generating high traffic volume.
  - Patterns of spoofed IPs and randomized source ports.
- **Effectiveness of Mitigation**:
  - Rate limiting and IP filtering significantly reduce the impact of DoS attacks.
  - WAFs are essential for protecting application-layer resources from HTTP floods.
